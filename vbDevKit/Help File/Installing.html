	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes time to deploy your application,
	all you will have to do is make sure to copy over the VBDevKit.dll
	as part of the install and register it.
	<br><br>
	
	Most installers have an register function, if you want to do it manually
	then you can just execute:
	<br><bR>
	
	shell "regsvr32 """ & pathToDLL & """ /s" ,vbhide
	
	<br><br>
	This will register the DLl on their system. If the target system is 
	Windows 98, 95 or NT you may also have to make sure that they have the 
	VB 6 runtimes on thier system. Since you are most likly a VB developer,
	You will need these runtimes anyway. The VB Runtimes come installed by
	default on Windows ME, XP, and 2000. Only if you plan to support windows
	98 and lower do you have to worry about this if you are not a VB 6
	developer.
