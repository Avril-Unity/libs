	<br><br>
	
	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	This Library is an ActiveX Dll that can be utilized from any Language 
	that supports ActiveX objects such as Visual Basic, Delphi, C++, Even
	Interpreted Languages such as VBS and JS in the Windows Script Host
	Enviroment !

	<br><br>

	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	This Library extends and simplifies a host of programming tasks and
	makes even the newest developer comfortable and productive.

	<br><br>

	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	The Simple function names and intutive interfaces make coding with
	the VB Dev Kit a breeze. This is because I have developed these libraries
	over the coarse of the last 4 years, and I have developed then to be exactly
	what I needed.

	The VB Developers Kit is written in pure VB and Windows Api which means that it needs
	no other components (other than the VB 6 Runtimes of course) to operate. The VB runtimes
	come installed by default on Windows ME,XP, and 2000 machines. For Older machines, such
	as Win95, 98 and NT they will have to have the VB 6 Runtimes installed before you use
	the VB Developers Kit.
