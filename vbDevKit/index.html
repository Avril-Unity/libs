	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	The VB Developers Kit is written in pure VB and Windows Api which means that it needs
	no other components (other than the VB 6 Runtimes of course) to operate. The VB runtimes
	come installed by default on Windows ME,XP, and 2000 machines. For Older machines, such
	as Win95, 98 and NT they will have to have the VB 6 Runtimes installed before you use
	the VB Developers Kit.

<!--
	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;
	The trial version of the VBDevKit is free to try for an unlimited time. Purchasing it will
	give you an unlock code so that the nag screen will not appear at the beginning of each run.
