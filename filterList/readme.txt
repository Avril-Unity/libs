with a built in filter textbox on the bottom.

very similar to use as original, couple bonus functions thrown
in on top. 

simple but very useful.

set integer FilterColumn to determine which column it searchs 
0 is .text rest is .subitem index

obscure feature: the filter text box can also double as a command
line processor.

currently supports
