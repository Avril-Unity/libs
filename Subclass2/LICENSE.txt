
This is a free, easy to use, Subclass component made in VB6.
------------------------------------------------------------

Why another subclassing component? 

    Well, I needed one I wrote from scratch to use with my products
    and that was free from all other Licensing terms. I also wanted
    a more streamlined interface than some of the others I had used.

    This dll uses a simple single event based interface. To use it,
    just create a class variable withevents. To specify which messages
    you want to receive, you just call a function in the class telling it
    which window you want to subclass and which message to look for.

    When the message is received, it will raise an event that you 
    will process in your code. In the event handler you can directly modify
    parameters or cancel the message. 


How was this component developed? What are its capabilities?

    you can have an unlimited number of classes, and should be
    able to subclass an unlimited number of windows. Each class
    can in turn subclass as many windows as it wants, and it should
    be able to attach to as many messages per window as it wants.

    You can edit message parameters and cancel them directly in
    the eventhandler you implement for the clsSubClass in your code.

    One thing you cannot do, is to have multiple classes subclass the
    same window looking for the same message. (although multiple classes
    should be able to share the subclass of any hwnd, they just cant
    receive the same msg.


What are the licensing terms on spSubClass ?

   You are free to use it in any personal or commercial applications
   you create royality free. A brief "This product contains software  
   written by David Zimmer" would be nice in your copyright info, but  
   it is definatly not required.

   You are free to distribute the dll with your applications, however you 
   cannot redistribute my installer, my site shall remain the only to offer   
   this component for download unless I  either personally submit it to you
   or you ask my permission before hand.

   This software is provided as is with no warrenty as to merchantability or fitness
   for any particular use, in no event shall the author be liable for any direct, 
   indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including, 
   but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data,
   or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, 
   whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) 
   arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility
   of such damage. 


What dependencies does it have?

   Since it is written in VB6, it does require the Vb runtime (msvbvm6.dll )
   Chances are you too are a VB developer so this will not affect you. There 
   are no other external dependancies.


Is source code available for the Dll?

   The source code to the dll will not be made publically available.
