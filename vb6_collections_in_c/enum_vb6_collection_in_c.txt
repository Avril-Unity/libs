How can I write a VC6 client app which iterates thru a VB collection class
residing in a DLL written VB6? In VB it would read

For Each elem in elems
    ' Do something with this elem of the coellection elems.
Next

How can I do that in a VC app?

I wrapped the DLL and its classes in VC as advised in KB article Q194873. I
can see all the methods exported and among them is GetNewEnum(). GetNewEnum
returns an LPUNKNOWN. What do I have to do with this pointer?

Any hint is appreciated.

Here is how it works:

   // Get the names of all the libs
   IEnumVARIANT *pEnum = 0;
   LPUNKNOWN pUnk = m_rwLibsOfConn.GetNewEnum();
   _ASSERTE(pUnk);
   HRESULT hr = pUnk->QueryInterface(IID_IEnumVARIANT, (void **)&pEnum);
   pUnk->Release();
   VARIANT varRWLib;
   unsigned long ulNumElems;
   CStringArray astrRWLibName;
   while (0 == (hr = pEnum->Next(1, &varRWLib, &ulNumElems)) && 1 ==
ulNumElems)
   {
      _RWLib rwLib;
      rwLib.AttachDispatch(varRWLib.pdispVal);
      astrRWLibName.Add(rwLib.GetItsName());
   }
   pEnum->Release();

Thanks to all who contributed!
