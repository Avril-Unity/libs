Title: SelfSub 2.1 updates and additions. Apr 13
Description: What: the latest version of my subclassing components. Why: this update fixes DEP (Data Execution Prevention) issues on 64bit Windows and XP SP2 with NX/XD cpu support. Additionally, I&#8217;ve eliminated the public callback; here the self-sub callback is the final private method. Who: whilst this submission will mostly interest UserControl authors, the cSelfSub sample class, cShadow, should be of general appeal. SelfSub 2.1 Apr 13 Additions: general purpose callback thunks. Updates: see comments
