	A very frequently used component for the VB developer is the 
	Internet Explorer control. It lends itself to all kinds of 
	functions because of its adaptability, network enablement, and
	powerful document rendering capabilities. 
	<br><br>
	
	It does however lack in certain areas for the Vb developer. How
	often have you wanted:
	
	<ul>
	<li>remove its 3d borders
	<li>turn off its scrollbars
	<li>ensure that scripting is enabled
	<li>replace or turn off standard context menus
	<li>add buttons to the IE toolbar
	<li>add your own items to IE context sensitive menus
	<li>access VB form objects and functions from 
        javascript</li>    	   
	</ul>
	
	With the IE Developers Kit, all of this is now easily within your
	grasp, and these are just a handful of the things that the IE developers
	pack can help you do.
	
	<br><br>
	All of these things have previously taken alot of code and knowledge to 
	pull off. This has effectivly left the majority&nbsp;of users having to&nbsp;just&nbsp;accept&nbsp;what they&nbsp;had to live without.
	Just think of the possibilities these new features open and you will  be amazed.
	<br><br>
	
	   This component encapsulates literally months of
	research, reading, and experimentation. As with all other SandSprite.com components,
	the clean interface design and user friendly functions,&nbsp;will&nbsp;make this a breeze to 
	use for developers of any skill level.
	<br><br>
	
	 Take a look at the sample application interface to see a&nbsp;sampling of the functions
	it encapsulates.

	The interface it all. If you are like me, you have 	been searching for all  
	of these capabilities in an easy to use no hassel control for a long time.
