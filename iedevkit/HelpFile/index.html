	A very frequently used component for the VB developer is the 
	Internet Explorer component. It lends itself to all kinds of 
	functions because of its adaptability, network enablement, and
	powerful document rendering capabilities. 
	<br><br>
	
	It does however lack in certain areas for the Vb developer. How
	often have you wanted to remove its 3d borders, turn off its scrollbars,
	ensure that scripting is enabled, turn off context menus, or replace
	them with your own? 
	<br><br>
	
	These just list a handful of the things that the IE developers
	pack can help you do. Things that have previously either taken 
	alot of code and knowledge to pull off, or things that most of us
	jsut had to accept as not possible.
	<br><br>
	
	This component encapsulates literally months of research, reading, and
	experimentation. As with all other SandSprite.com components, the clean
	interface design and user friendly functions should make this a breeze to 
	use. 
	<br><br>
	
	Take a look at the sample applications interface to see a host the functions
	it encapsulates.

	The interface and demo program says it all. If you are like me, you have 
	been searching for all  of these abilities in a control for a long time.
	This product is free software and canbe used freely for both commercial
        and non-commercial applications without restriction.
