ÿÇThe context menu demo will add 2 context menus. One on the defualt menu called "Always there" and one on the links right click menu called "Only for Links" both of these actions will run a  demo script that has the same access described above. The Links script will show a sample UI.

The remove button will remove the toolbars added in this demo.

the Enumerate button will show a listing of all the menu items added in this manner on your machine.
ÿ
After clicking add, open up a new instance of Internet Explorer and you should see the new icon on the toolbar. 

If you have ever customized yout toolbar, the icon will not appear. This is IE default behavior...i do not know how to work around it yet.

Modify will change its tooltip

Remove will remove it. Open up New IE windows for each test. Because this example
code only stores the last toolbar button identity you added, and only in memory if you add multiple toolbars or close between runs you will have to remove them manually.

The toolbar button action is to run a html script that executes with full
access to the parent Ie window as well as executing in the local machine zone
so that you can use the filesystem object and any other custom active x controls.
