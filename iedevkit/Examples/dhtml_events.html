	This Example will show you how you can easily hook
	events by attaching your own custom functions to objects
	in a web page. This can include any event handler that
	the browser and html support !
	<br><br>
	The button below, has no onclick event attached to it in the
	html. Using the clsDhtmlEvent, we are able to attach an event
	from VB so that when it is clicked, it runs our code in the
	VB Form.
