Title: Menu Builder (featuring runtime preview)
Description: Menu builder is featuring file drag & drop, 
smooth listBox item dragging for parent and child node,
clipboard copy and paste operation using cutsom clipboard format, and 
previewing menu as a menubar or popup menu in real tme. 
 And, also generates API created menu code for the given VB menu.
 
 Above of all, internally, it parses the tree structure of VB menu text correctly, 
 with resuable pasring class modules. I think they can be used for other purposes and projects.
